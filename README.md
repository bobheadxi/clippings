# ðŸ”– Clippings

An opinionated and minimal highlights and references importer and manager for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
Clippings is geared towards casuals like myself, who just want to keep track of and review their Instapaper highlights and haphazardly copy-pasted notes from articles and websites, and easily reference them throughout their notes.
You might be interested if you haven't caught on to one of the Readwise-based or Zotero-based Obsidian plugins.
